### BUSY AF ###
Welp, it's just become a fact of my life now... i'm just always BUSY these days. 
Wish i had more time to spend coding on some of these projects. 

### Summer ###
Especially busy with homesteading, expect slow response times

### Winter ###
Still busy... but i should have bouts of time to squeeze in some extra coding ;)
